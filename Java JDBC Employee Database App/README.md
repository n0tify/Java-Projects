🎯 Interview Questions Covered
What is JDBC?
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API that enables Java applications to interact with databases using SQL.

What is PreparedStatement?
A PreparedStatement is a precompiled SQL statement used for executing parameterized queries. It helps prevent SQL injection.

Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?

Statement is used for static SQL, whereas PreparedStatement supports dynamic queries with parameters.

PreparedStatement is safer and more efficient.

How do you handle SQL exceptions?
Using try-catch blocks with SQLException, often logging e.getMessage() and e.printStackTrace().

How to prevent SQL Injection?
By using PreparedStatement instead of concatenating user inputs into SQL strings.

What is JDBC DriverManager?
A class that manages a list of database drivers and handles connection requests.

How to close connections?
Always close Connection, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet in a finally block or use try-with-resources.

What is a ResultSet?
A ResultSet is a table of data representing a database result set, generated by executing a query.

What is auto-commit in JDBC?
If autoCommit is true, every SQL statement is committed to the database as soon as it is executed.

How to connect Java to MySQL?
